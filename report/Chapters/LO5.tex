\chapter{Evaluation}
Evaluating visualizations is of paramount importance because it impacts how individuals, 
organizations, and societies interpret and make decisions based on data. Poorly designed 
visualizations can lead to misunderstandings, incorrect conclusions, and misguided 
decisions, whereas effective visualizations can facilitate better understanding, 
insights, and actions. In fields where data and decisions are criticalâ€”such as science, 
business, and public policy -- the ability to accurately and effectively visualize information 
is a powerful tool for communication and understanding.

\section*{Evaluating Visualizations with Usability Testing}
Usability testing is a popular User Experience research methodology that focuses on collecting
insights, findings, and anecdotes about how people view a visualization. In a usability-testing 
session, a researcher, also known as a facilitator or moderator, asks a participant to perform 
tasks using specific user interfaces while observing the participant's behavior and listening to their feedback. 
Qualitative usability testing is best for discovering problems in the user experience and 
is more common than quantitative usability testing, which focuses on collecting metrics to 
describe the user experience.
